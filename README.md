Catppuccin consists of 4 beautiful pastel color palettes, named flavors. The theme comes in one light and three dark variants:

- ðŸŒ» **Latte**: Our lightest theme harmoniously inverting the essence of Catppuccin's dark themes.
- ðŸª´ **FrappÃ©**: A less vibrant alternative using subdued colors for a muted aesthetic.
- ðŸŒº **Macchiato**: Medium contrast with gentle colors creating a soothing atmosphere.
- ðŸŒ¿ **Mocha**: The Original â€” Our darkest variant offering a cozy feeling with color-rich accents.
